- You might want to wait for Amy and Drew to comment as well, but to
me the opening examples feel a little too broad, and not closely
matched to the structure of the hypothesis testing task. I do share
Amy's desire to have the start of the paper connect a little to a real
world problem, but it should also be clearly connected (in spirit at
least) to the experiment that you run. The issue as I see it is that
almost anything in which humans obtain data and make inferences can be
construed as a form of hypothesis testing, and I don't think anyone
would feel that our task is a good proxy for all of them. For
instance, the doctor example is a little unusual in that the doctor's
goal isn't to learn about the concept of "illness X", it is to
diagnose patients.

- I think the definition of sparsity is a unclear. What does it mean
to refer to "the proportion of all members of a domain that are
indexed by the hypothesis in question"? A naive reader won't
understand what "indexed by" means in this context. I think it might
make more sense to try to say that every hypothesis picks out a set of
entities for which it is true: e.g., if we're talking about a
language, then every hypothesis about that language corresponds to a
set of possible sentences that would be grammatical if the hypothesis
were true. A hypothesis is said to be "sparse" if that set contains
only a minority of possible entities.  I'm not generally in favour of
suggesting that people use wordier language, but in this case I think
you need to do something to make clear what "indexed by a hypothesis"
means.

- Method section. What do you mean when you say "180 people
contributed 360 trials"? A "trial" usually refers to a single short
event in an experiment. It feels a little weird to me to refer to an
entire sorting task as one trial, especially since that task consists
of multiple qualitatively distinct events (i.e., label requests vs
sort actions).

- Check to make sure you've used US spelling: "coloured" -> "colored",
"behaviour" -> "behavior", "generalise" -> "generalize" etc

- Figure 7 has the low scoring group in the top row, and the high
scoring group in the bottom row. I'd reverse this. Also, either have
the figure caption state which is which explicitly, or change the
labelling of the rows to say "high scoring" and "low scoring". That's
easier to process than the "score <=600" text, which is pretty
meaningless to the casual reader.

- As Amy and I both mentioned, your writing is good given that this is
your first paper. However, I think you need to work on simplifying
your language a little. I think you have a slight tendency to wander
off topic a little. Example:

"Individual participants reflected sensitivity to the information
value of the different request types in a coarse-grained way,
gravitating to either balanced requests or requests of a single type".

This sentence has two parts. The first part of it refers to
"sensitivity to information value", which sets up the reader to think
that you're about to talk about how people's information requests
change as a function of sparsity. But the second half of the sentence
doesn't talk about that at all. Instead, it talks about the fact that
there were a large number of people whose requests were either 100%
positive, 50% positive or 0% positive. Nowhere does this sentence (or
the rest of the paragraph) explain how these three strategies imply
any "sensitivity to information value", "coarse-grained" or otherwise.
I *think* that what you have in mind is the fact that the proportion
of people using these strategies shifts across conditions. But that
doesn't come through in the text.

I feel like that part was supposed to be a bridge with the previous
paragraph? Maybe you wanted to say something like

"Although the overall proportion of positive requests changed
systematically across conditions, there was also systematic variation
within each condition." ... and then go on to talk about the three
strategies???


Hope that helps. Have to dash. Train coming. Sorry if the email was
terse: writing in a rush!!

Cheers
